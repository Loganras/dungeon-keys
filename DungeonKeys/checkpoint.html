<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Here is a list of what you can do to test what I've actually done so far<br>
1.  When the page is loaded the initial game is setup.  To reset the game<br>
simply refresh the web page.  I still need to make a level sequence handler<br>
which will help this part happen a little more functionally.<br><br>
2.  The yellow square is the 'player' character.  To move the character<br>
simply press any of the arrow keys to move the respective direction.  You<br>
can see when you run into the dark grey colored tiles that it will not let<br>
you pass through them because they are collidable.  Summed up, to test basic<br>
movement just move around with the arrow keys.  The whole level is actuallly<br>
larger than the viewable tiles that you can currently see.  If you move the<br>
character around a bit you will be able to see the character move, and the<br>
view window move as well.  We spoke about this in a meeting, and I was able<br>
to implement it pretty well.  The 'view window'.<br><br>
3.  Test out key collection.  If you move your character over a square with<br>
no letter inside of it, you will collect a 'key'.  On the bottom of the page<br>
you will see a message saying what key you collected.  Also, the inventory<br>
on the right side of the screen will show you what keys are in your inventory.<br><br>
4.  Test out the locked door funcitonality.  To test the doors, try to walk<br>
through a block with a 'D' on it without that color of key.  If it's locked<br>
and you don't have the key it will have a message at the bottom of the screen<br>
saying it's locked.  If you try to walk through it and you have the key it<br>
will say you opened the door and it will let you through.<br><br>
5.  You can change your name on the character!  Just type in your name<br>
in the textbox that is at the top of the screen and click Submit.<br>
It is not actually a submit button, it just has the value of submit.<br>
When you click on submit it will give you a message telling you your<br>
name will be displayed on your character.<br><br>
6.  You can change the 'zoom' of the game window.  If you select a value<br>
from the dropdown menu 'Zoom', and click submit, it will reset the number<br>
viewable tiles in the game.  It does not reset the game, just the zoom.<br>
Sometimes the zoom sets you're character out of the screen, I still need<br>
to fix that...  You have to move back to the center for it to behave right.<br><br>
7.  Clickable tiles.  You can click on a tile, and it will print the literal<br>
table cell location, not the location on the game world.  If you want to see<br>
the location of the player in the game world look at the red debugging area<br>
that is below all the rest of the game.  When you click on a tile the message<br>
will appear in this red div, so look for it there.<br></p>

<h1>To-Do</h1>
<h2>Constructors</h2>
<p>createSwitch: will create a switch object<br>
createMob: will create a monster object<br>
createPlayer: possibly add a second player, which will require a constructor<br>
</p>

<h2>Array</h2>
<p>switches: will store the switch objects to place on the map<br>
mobs: will store the monster objects to place on the map<br>
players: will possibly store multiple players...<br></p>

<h2>Engine</h2>
<p>I will need to write code that handles monster movement and interaction...<br>
switches: I will need to write code to handle how switches will work<br>
Levels: I need to implement how mutliple levels will be entered into<br>
For Example...  How you enter level 2 from level 1<br></p>

<h2>Level-Design</h2>
<p>One major part of the game that I need to figure out is the actual puzzles<br>
that will be in the game.  So far I have a basic guy that can run around and collect<br>
keys and open doors, only if you have the key.  It's a good, and very basic part of<br>
the game, but it's not enough to make it particularly interesting.  What I need to do<br>
now is make it so it requires some skill to actually obtain each key inside each room.<br></p>
