<strong>The requirements for the final project:</strong><br>
1. Documentation file: exists and explains how requirements were met.<br><br>
2. Game grid uses CSS generated by JavaScript: The grid for the game is generated using a javascript array/json, and styled using CSS and images.<br><br>
3. User Input: I have implemented a user input text, which allows the user to "name" their character that moves around on the screen.  
I have also implemented a drop down selection box that allows you to effectively 'zoom in' so that the game shows less tiles around your character.  
To apply both of these options the user must click the submit button that is next to the fields.
On top of these inputs, I made my game based off of the arrow keys.  Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys move the character around the screen.<br><br>
4. Mouse Click Input: If a user clicks inside one of the cells it will change the css of that cell, showing that you clicked it.  However, if you move your character it will redraw the correct image for that cell.<br><br>
5. Dynamic modification of HTML: Constantly throughout the gameplay the cells are changing using the DOM functions.  The images change as you move around, or click on the cells.  I used innerHTML to place the text in each cell.
The cells also change as you interact with the different objects in the game.  For example, when you step on a switch the corresponding door will disappear, then magically come back if you don't make it in time.<br><br>
6. XMLHttpRequest: I decided to just use the Assignment 6 specifications and work for the XMLHttpRequest JSON/XML requirement.  The JSON file that is read in is parsed and displayed on the index page at the bottom.  It contains
an example of the layout of a level for the game.<br><br>
7. HTML5: I have implemented many different sounds via the HTML5 audio tags (make sure you have the latest firefox, or else the sound won't work).  The audio tags (except for the looping music) are all triggered to play via JavaScript code.  Sounds that I implemented are key pickup, door locked,
door open, door closed, switch stepped on, wall run into, stepping into water, and the winning applause.  (all sounds provided freely by www.soundjay.com)<br><br>
8. Game Logic Code:<br><br>
A. For my game I made a large map, and a viewable window that is actually seen by the player as the venture throught the dungeon.  This makes the screen only show a small portion of that larger map.  I had to figure out
how to make only the correct portions show, using arrays and for loops to print it out.  I had to assign the player object a location within the map, and the view is based off of where the player is.<br><br>
B. The player will always be centered in the screen, unless he/she is near the edge of the map.  If the player is near the edge of the map the character will move out of the center of the view window, and toward the direction
that was pressed on the arrow keys.  Once the character again is in the center the view window will move with the charcter in the center.<br><br>
C. Keys: I made Keys the basis of the whole game.  I had to make the code interact correctly with keys and doors.  If you have a key and move into the door, there is a check for collision into a solid object, if it's a door
the game is checked to see if the correct key has been picked up.  If it has the player opens the door and can move through, if not the player runs into a locked door and cannot pass.<br><br>
D. Switches: I made switches similar to keys.  The difference is that I used setTimeout() to make the switch actually trigger the door to open, and close after that time has passed. If you make it through the door in time
the door will remain open, as you have completed that particular challenge.
E. I incorporated a small feedback messages box at the bottom of the game window.  As you interact with objects on the screen the message will let you know what just happened.  Example, when you try to step into water there
will be a message (and a sound, woot!) that says you stepped into water but decided to stay dry instead.  Other examples are doors opening, doors locked, switches pressed, hit a wall...<br><br>
9. I removed my preliminary software design and updated software design sections from the index page.  I felt they made the page too cluttery...  However they are in comments still.  I also removed the login buttons/textboxes, and clear storage options
because they do not apply to my game.  I got full credit for those on previous assignments so I felt it was ok to remove them for the final project, in order to unclutter the game.
